ARATEI


Aratei means sunday in the Guarani language. A language spoken in Paraguay, South of Brazil and a part from Argentina.


This project is intended to integrate different music apis (as an integration exercise), having all of it tested,
with interfaces, dockers and more tools. The project was created in my free time beginning on a random sunday at home
when my kids were sleeping (that's why the name arateÄ©).

What does the project do?
The app is in charge of:
- Exposes a REST API using FastAPI.
- Asynchronously fetches data from different music APIs (Spotify, Deezer, etc.)
- Mapps the data using pydantic models.
- Stores the data in a PostgresSQL database.
- Executed in Docker containers.
- Tested with pytest
